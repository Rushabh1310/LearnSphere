# LearnSphere - Online Education Platform

## Project Description

**LearnSphere** is a fully functional ed-tech platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content, making education more accessible and engaging for students while providing instructors with a space to showcase their expertise.

### Key Features

- **Seamless Learning Experience**: Interactive and engaging content for students.
- **Instructors' Platform**: Instructors can create and manage courses and connect with learners worldwide.

## System Architecture

StudyNotion follows a client-server architecture, consisting of three main components:

1. **Front-end**: Built using ReactJS for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
2. **Back-end**: Built using Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests and processing business logic.
3. **Database**: MongoDB for flexible, scalable data storage.

- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, update, delete, and manage courses.
- **Payment Integration**: Razorpay is integrated for course payments.
- **Cloud-based Media Management**: Cloudinary is used for media content storage and management.
- **Markdown Support**: Course content stored in Markdown format for easier rendering.

### Back-end Technologies
- **Node.js**: Back-end framework.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB.
- **JWT**: For secure authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: For password hashing.

## API Design

The LearnSphere platform follows REST architecture, with APIs implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The APIs exchange data in JSON format and follow standard HTTP methods.

### Sample API Endpoints

- **User Authentication**
  - `POST /api/auth/signup`: Sign up a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user.
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`: Verify OTP for email validation.
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: Send a password reset link to email.
  
- **Course Management**
  - `GET /api/courses`: Fetch all available courses.
  - `GET /api/courses/:id`: Fetch a specific course by ID.
  - `POST /api/courses`: Create a new course.
  - `PUT /api/courses/:id`: Update a course.
  - `DELETE /api/courses/:id`: Delete a course.
  - `POST /api/courses/:id/rate`: Rate a course.
